      Homepage of the In adiutorium project offers
      Liturgy of the Hours musical scores for the current liturgical season.
      For determination of the current liturgical season and day
      it relies on Church Calendar API.
      The "liturgical today" is retrieved once a day and cached until midnight.

    %p
      Catholic Flash is an app for Amazon Alexa. It provides you with
      information from the Catholic liturgical calendar as part of your Alexa
      daily briefing. For example, it would tell you something like, "Today is
      the 18th Friday in ordinary time and is the feast day of Saint Augustine."
